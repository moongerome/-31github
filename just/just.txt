The term "ape" can refer to a few different things:
The main difference between the present perfect simple and present perfect continuous tenses lies in how they express the completion and duration of actions up to the present moment.

Present Perfect Simple:

Structure: Subject + has/have + past participle (e.g., I have worked).
Use:
Indicates an action that started in the past and has a connection to the present.
Focuses on the completion of the action rather than its duration.
Often used with stative verbs (e.g., know, have, understand).
Example: "I have visited Paris." (The action of visiting Paris is complete, and the emphasis is on the fact that it happened at some point in the past.)

Present Perfect Continuous:

Structure: Subject + has/have + been + present participle (verb + -ing) (e.g., I have been working).
Use:
Indicates an action that started in the past, is ongoing, and may continue into the present.
Emphasizes the duration or continuity of the action.
Often used with dynamic verbs (e.g., work, play, run).
Example: "I have been working on this project." (The action of working started in the past, has been ongoing, and may continue; the emphasis is on the duration and the process of working.)
